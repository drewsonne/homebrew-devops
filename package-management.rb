  #   # This test will fail and we won't accept that! It's enough to just replace
  #   # "false" with the main program this formula installs, but it'd be nice if you
  #   # were more thorough. Run the test with `brew test package-management`. Options passed
  #   # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.
  #   #
  #   # The installed folder is not in the path, so use the entire path to any
  #   # executables being tested: `system "#{bin}/program", "do", "something"`.
